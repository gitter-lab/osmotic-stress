# Osmotic stress (HOG) pathway data files

## sources
Source proteins (receptors) in the pathway:
- osmotic-sources-sdrem.txt: the five sources used in the SDREM paper
http://genome.cshlp.org/content/23/2/365.abstract
- osmotic-sources-kegg.txt: source proteins from KEGG
http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?sce04011
- osmotic-sources-kegg-sdrem.txt: the union of the sources from the above
two references

## evaluation
HOG pathway references and osmotic stress screens used in the SDREM evaluation.
Many of these are stale and need to be updated:
- goldStandard: these files are a summary of multiple reference pathway
databases and HOG pathway reviews
- Hillenmeyer: an osmotic stress chemical screen
- SGD osmotic stress.txt: genes from the SGD database annotated with
osmotic stress-related screening phenotypes

There is also the recent yeast pathway review article
