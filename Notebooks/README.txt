	- PrizesNotebook
Second Step:
	- Examination of Prizes and Interactome
	- General Information-DirUndir
Third Step:
	- Apply Thresholds
Fourth Step:
	- Run PCSF with input data
Fifth Step: 
	- Use summarization notebook/script
Sixth Step:
	- ParameterChoice
Seventh Step:
	- Run PCSF with noise
Eight Step:
	- Summarization notebook/script
Ninth Step:
	- Forest to TPS
Tenth Step: 
	- Run TPS

Kinase_Target_Evaluation: use the datasets in the `data/evaluation` subdirectory to evaluate the predicted targets of Rck2 and Cdc28.
Also simplify the SGD id mapping file.
