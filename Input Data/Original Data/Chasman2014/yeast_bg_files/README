Background network split into four pieces.
Punctuation was removed from yeast ORFs; namely YDR363W-A becomes YDR363WA.

Columns:
(1) "etype": short phrase indicating type of edge; one of
acetylation|cxcx|cxorf|deacetylation|demethylation|deubiquitination|downstr_source|glycosylation|incomplex|kinasesubstrate|literature|literaturephos|metapath|methylation|modification|neddrub1ylation|phosdephos|phosphatasesubstrate|ppi|prenylation|proteolyticprocessing|rbp_protein|sumoylation|ubiquitination|dna_bind|rna_bind|translate

* cxcx : inferred complex-complex interaction (at least 50% of possible interactions between two protein complexes observed in PPI network)
* cxorf : inferred complex-protein interaction (at least 50% of proteins in complex interact with the other protein in PPI network)
* rbp_protein : original data specified RNA-binding protein->mRNA; this edge represents RBP->mRNA->protein product of mRNA. 
* translate : RNA to protein product (not used here)

(2) geneA  
(3) geneB 
(4) dir : is edge directed? 1 if yes, 0, if no. If 1, edge is ordered geneA to geneB. If 0, node order doesn't matter and nodes will be in alphabetical order.
(5) sign : -1 for repression, 1 for activation, 0 for unspecified.
(6) source : name of database, person, first author of paper that provided the interaction. (edges with sources in form authorYear are typically from BioGRID.)
(7) pmid : pubmed ID (typically from BioGRID)

Files:

final_internal_norbp_nopunct.tab : 
 "Internal" (protein-protein) network, including kinase-substrate interactions and manually curated interactions from Audrey (source includes "audrey")
 
final_one_step_rbp_nopunct.tab :
I put the RBP->protein edges into a separate file.
 
final_binding_nopunct_noselfreg.tab :
protein-DNA interactions only. Removed any self-regulation edges.
